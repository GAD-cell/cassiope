  abstract  = "Computing shortest paths is a fundamental operation in
               processing graph data. In many real-world applications,
               discovering shortest paths between two vertices empowers us to
               make full use of the underlying structure to understand how
               vertices are related in a graph, e.g. the strength of social
               ties between individuals in a social network. In this paper, we
               study the shortest-path-graph problem that aims to efficiently
               compute a shortest path graph containing exactly all shortest
               paths between any arbitrary pair of vertices on complex
               networks. Our goal is to design an exact solution that can scale
               to graphs with millions or billions of vertices and edges. To
               achieve high scalability, we propose a novel method,
               Query-by-Sketch (QbS), which efficiently leverages offline
               labelling (i.e., precomputed labels) to guide online searching
               through a fast sketching process that summarizes the important
               structural aspects of shortest paths in answering
               shortest-path-graph queries. We theoretically prove the
               correctness of this method and analyze its computational
               complexity. To empirically verify the efficiency of QbS, we
               conduct experiments on 12 real-world datasets, among which the
               largest dataset has 1.7 billion vertices and 7.8 billion edges.
               The experimental results show that QbS can answer
               shortest-path-graph queries in microseconds for million-scale
               graphs and less than half a second for billion-scale graphs.",
